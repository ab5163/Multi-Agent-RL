Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Smart Grids
## Overview
Utilities are experiencing increasing levels of penetration of flexible energy loads and electric vehicles (EVs). Uncoordinated control and charging may produce congestions in energy distribution systems. This project developes multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for optimal control of flexible energy loads and EVs in smart grids. The agents will minimize not only their energy consumption cost but also total energy losses in the system while maintaining its constraints.
